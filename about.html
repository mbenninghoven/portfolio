  		<h2>Introduction</h2>
  			<p>I am a Technical Support Engineer by day and an amateur vegan chef by night. I have been comfortable with technology ever since I was seven years old after my mom purchased a brand new Apple computer. The rest is history. I have owned an Apple repair business, worked as an iOS technician at an Apple flagship store in San Francisco and now work for a streaming software company near Portland, OR.
   		 	Alongside my career in tech, I have taught myself how to cook delicious vegan faire. You can check out all my dishes and vegan food adventures on my instagram page @portlandvegans.</p>

  		<h3>My Experience in Tech</h3>
  			<p>I started working on iPhones when I was 22. I found I was quite comfortable in tearing down the different models of iPhone and fixing various issues within the hardware. From my experience in repair, I was hired at the Apple Store in Union Square, San Francisco. I worked at the Genius Bar reparing and troubleshooting iOS and Mac devices.
			In 2013, I moved to Portland, OR and started working in a Microsoft environment for a company that developed IVR technology for government agencies. It was here that I became exposed to various programming languages and tools such a C# and SQL. I also learned a great deal of troubleshooting on Windows machines which gave me an edge up in knowing two major OS platforms.

			Now I work for a software company that develops audio encoding software and an advertising platform for digital media sales. Here I work with JavaScript, SQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. My skill level with these various languages is not yet mastered which is what I plan to accomplish within the next year.</p>
